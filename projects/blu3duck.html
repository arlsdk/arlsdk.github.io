        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>Blu3duck is a project that lets you use your Arduino as a Bluetooth controlled Universal Keyboard/Mouse emulator with spoofable VID/PID.</p>

        <p>Normally, using an Arduino UNO or MEGA is kind of impossible for emulating Keyboard/Mouse. In this project I used <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2">HoodLoader2</a> to be able to use the 16u2 chip on Arduino UNO, just so I can emulate and use its Keyboard/Mouse functions without losing access for the program on 328p.</p>

        <h2>Parts</h2>
        <p>You should have 4 parts, and after that, you're all set:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Any Bluetooth Terminal App:</strong> To use the functions of the code.</li>
            <li><strong>Arduino Uno:</strong> To create the entire project. You must use one that comes with 16u2, 8u2 or 32u4. CH340G won't work.</li>
            <li><strong>HC-05 Bluetooth Module:</strong> To be able to communicate between your Smartphone and Arduino.</li>
            <li><strong>HoodLoader2:</strong> Firmware that allows reprogramming of the 16u2 chip. You should visit its Wiki page to understand the basics, <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2/wiki">Wiki.</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Setting up the Blu3duck project is pretty easy,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You should first install <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2">HoodLoader2</a> on your Arduino (due is not supported). Please read the Wiki to understand how it works.</li>
            <li>After installing the HoodLoader2, you should upload the <a href="https://github.com/arlsdk/blu3duck/tree/main/328p">code</a> for the 328p (or your Chip, shouldn't make a difference). Please pay attention to the Board Selection on Arduino IDE.</li>
            <li>After uplading the first part of code, you will now upload the second part. This part is going to emulate a Keyboard. We will upload it to the 16u2.</li>
            <li>Please switch to 16u2 (HoodLoader 16u2 is the board name). Follow the Wiki page to understand <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2/wiki/How-to-use-reset">how.</a></li>
            <li>Once you switch to the 16u2, you should be ready to upload the <a href="https://github.com/arlsdk/blu3duck/tree/main/16u2">code</a> for 16u2.</li>
            <li>Once you upload to the 16u2, you should be ready to use Blu3duck. Do not forget to tip your PIN (just once) before running any command ;).</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>But, how?</h2>
        <p>I don't know i you've spotted it, but we used 2 different code to create our own Blu3duck.</p>

        <p>One for the 328p and one for 16u2. This is exactly how it works:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>The code in the 328p listens for any command/text that comes from your Bluetooth Terminal.</li>
            <li>Spotted a command? 328p filters it and removes any unecessary part from it.</li>
            <li>Once done with the removing, 328p passes the command to the 16u2 through serial. To learn more, <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2/tree/master/avr/examples/HID-Bridge">HID Bridge.</a></li>
            <li>Once the 16u2 recevies a command, it filters and looks for matches for Special Keys (for example, the Windows Key on the Keyboard).</li>
            <li>If there is a match, it presses the key and then releases (.releaseAll()).</li>
            <li>If not, it writes the text that you've sent through your Bluetooth Terminal.</li>
        </ol>
